## Description.

ÖSQE is a Server OS made for folks on a budget! The only payments you can make for my Open Source? ***NONE!!!***. This is completely free to use, and great for old hardware, or cheap hardware. All you need?

- 2GB of ram at minimum.
- a storage device to keep all the files you need (256GB reccomemned, can be external or internal.)
- a computer that you can leave on 24/7/365
- A Computer to use if you need a GUI.
- WiFi or some kind of data
- USB stick or a CD/DVD to boot the OS on. (4GB of space is what you *may* need, currently unsure as we run in a VM as of now.)
- basic understanding of linux commands. (adding/removing packages, checking hardware with neofetch, & more since there is no GUI)
